        "- `attacker_id_anonymized`: an identifier for the attacker. Note that these are _different_ identifiers to the ones used on the Tensor Trust website, to make it a little bit harder to look up the access code for any defender.\n",
        "- `defender_id_anonymized`: defender ID, anonymized in the same way as the attacker ID.\n",
        "- `defense_id`: links to `defense_id` that links into the raw defenses dataset, shown below. **Not every row has this.** In particular, some very old attacks have no `defense_id` because of the way the game originally stored data, and \"sandbox\" attacks have no `defense_id` because they are not attacks on any specific player.\n",
        "- `attacker_balance_before`/`defender_balance_before`: How much money did the attacker and defender have at the time of the attack? **Not every row has this**, since we didn't record it early on in the game.\n",
        "- `attacker_balance_gain`/`defender_balance_gain`: If the attacker gained money from the attack, how much did they gain? Similar for the defender. Note that originally attackers _lost_ money for each attack; this is not captured by this field.\n",
        "- `opening_defense`/`closing_defense`: Defense prompt for the defender. **These fields may be null in some rows**, since we removed ToS-violating text from these fields.\n",
        "- `access_code`: The defender's actual access code. **May be null** if it violated the ToS.\n",
        "- `attacker_input:` The attack submitted by the attacker against the defender. **May be null** if it violated the ToS.\n",
        "- `llm_choice`: Which LLM was used to evaluate this attack? The LLM is chosen by the defender when they set their defense.\n",
        "- `llm_output`: Output of the LLM in response to the attack. **May be null** if it violated the ToS.\n",
        "- `output_is_access_granted`: Does the LLM output match our \"access granted\" regex?\n",
        "- `is_self_attack`: Was the user attacking themselves? This happens when a user is testing their own defense, or using the attack sandbox.\n",
        "- `timestamp`: Date on which the attack was saved (ISO8601 format).\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the `defense_id` column can probably be ignored for most purposes, since most of the information is already captured in the `opening_defense`/`closing_defense`/`access_code` fields; we include this column just as a convenience for looking up the defense objects themselves, which have slightly more information about the defense (like the LLM output, and the time the defense was created).\n",
